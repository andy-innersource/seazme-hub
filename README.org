** Usage

*** Prerequisites

- Git
- Most recent Java 8 JDK
- *[[https://leiningen.org][Leiningen]]* Clojure build tool
- For custom versions of =saml20-clj=, please install them locally with =lein install=

*** Demo

This repo maintains an =api= branch which when checked out, and started (as below), runs hub in demo mode and no calls to backend are executed. Username and password are =open= and =seazme=.

A convenient way to generate credential hash:
#+BEGIN_SRC
echo -n 'open:seazme' | openssl base64 | sed -e 's/^/Basic /' | tr -d '\n' | shasum
#+END_SRC

Please note, that in order to achieve that level of separation, all api changes must be carefully placed on top of =api= branch. Then =master= branch must be rebased on top of it.

*** Running

=lein ring server=

or

=lein ring server-headless=

*** Packaging and running as standalone jar

#+BEGIN_SRC
lein do clean, ring uberjar
java -jar target/datahubserv.jar
#+END_SRC

*** Packaging as war

=lein ring uberwar=
